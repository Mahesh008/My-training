    PROJECTS:
APB_SPI – Verification
Technology/Platform: System verilog
The APB is part of the AMBA  protocol family. It provides a low-cost interface  that is optimized for minimal power consumption and reduced interface complexity.
SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) are widely used to provide board-level interfaces between different devices such as microcontrollers, DACs, ADCs and others.
Registers need to be configured for proper operation of device. 
Architectured the class based environment in SV,verified the RTL module with single master and single slave.

Real Time Clock – RTL Design & Verification
Technology/Platform: verilog
Implemented a digital Real Time clock with the LCD character display driver, counting mechanism, alarm generator etc.
RTL supports LCD display controller, Alarm generator (alarm load/clear), Time Generator (actual time load/clear), Alarm sound generation, Key register and multiple Counters.
Block level verification of each block has been done.
All the blocks are integrated into the Top Level DUT
Top level verification done as per the test plan.

Arbiter:
             Technology/Platform: Verilog

              The role of the arbiter system is to control which master has access to the bus.


    Extra Co-Circular Activities:

Presented a paper on Wireless Power Transmission in Apogee at SCSVMV College  on April 2017.
